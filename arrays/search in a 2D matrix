https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/

In the leetcode version, one extra condition is there:

the first element of every row is greater than the last element of the previous row.

1st approach -> iterate through the 2D array row by row and search for the target.
 TC-> O(n*m)
 
2nd approach -> 
Click 1-> every row and every column is sorted. So, we can go for BS.
Do a BS on every row
TC-> O(n*logm)
